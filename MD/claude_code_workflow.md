## 🛠️ Advanced Features Integration

### Git Worktrees Management
```
# Create new worktree with automation script
WT feature-name

# Script automatically:
✅ Creates worktree and branch
✅ Opens new editor window
✅ Copies essential files (.env, .claude, .cursor)
✅ Sets up Claude Code instance
```

## 🎯 Best Practices Summary

### ✅ Do's
- 📋 **Always start with Plan Mode** (Shift + Tab)
- 🔄 **Commit frequently** as checkpoints
- 👀 **Review all AI-generated code** thoroughly
- 🗂️ **Use separate worktrees** for parallel development
- 📱 **Provide rich context** (screenshots, URLs, folders)
- 🎯 **Leverage custom slash commands** for efficiency
- 📊 **Monitor and measure** performance with hooks

### ❌ Don'ts
- 🚫 **Don't work on same branch** simultaneously
- 🚫 **Don't accept changes** without review
- 🚫 **Don't skip planning phase** for speed
- 🚫 **Don't ignore safety measures** (pre-tool hooks)
- 🚫 **Don't create worktrees** inside main project
- 🚫 **Don't forget to sync** claude.md across worktrees
- 🚫 **Don't skip transcript analysis** for improvement

## 🚀 Automation Scripts

### Worktree Creation Script (WT)
```bash
#!/bin/bash
# WT - Worktree automation script

FEATURE_NAME=$1
WORKTREE_DIR="../music-shop-worktrees/$FEATURE_NAME"

# Create worktree and branch
git worktree add $WORKTREE_DIR $FEATURE_NAME

# Copy essential files
cp .env $WORKTREE_DIR/
cp -r .claude $WORKTREE_DIR/
cp -r .cursor $WORKTREE_DIR/
cp claude.md $WORKTREE_DIR/

# Open new editor instance
cursor $WORKTREE_DIR &

echo "✅ Worktree '$FEATURE_NAME' created and ready!"
```

### Cleanup Script
```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Cleanup completed worktrees

FEATURE_NAME=$1
WORKTREE_DIR="../music-shop-worktrees/$FEATURE_NAME"

# Remove worktree
git worktree remove $WORKTREE_DIR

# Delete branch (optional)
git branch -d $FEATURE_NAME

echo "🗑️ Worktree '$FEATURE_NAME' cleaned up!"
```
